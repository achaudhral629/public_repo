RUN THIS PROGRAM:
 run interface.py 

HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS:
	This password manager works different than many other password managers. It does this by behaving like a password generator, in that it requires the user to input 5 data fields to generate a secure and unique password. This generated password can act as the actual password that the user will use for their account. 

	For example, the user would like a secure password for 'facebook.com' where their username is 'sarah123' and the master password they came up with is 'pass123', version number '1' and length '25'. The user only has to remember these 5 parameters to always get the same generated password, regardless of how many times they generate it, when they generate or what device they generate it on. They simply only need this program and the 5 parameters. The generated password only changes, if the parameters change or in other words when a user needs a password for a different account.


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
	In order to generate a unique and secure password, unique parameters are required. The first 3 parameters are self explanatory, the 4th one however, isn't. The purpose of version number is so that you can have a different password generated, with the other parameters unchanged i.e input '1' for the first time.

	As a side note, it is recommended to use atleast 20 characters for 'Password length desire', and select as many options (lowercase,numbers,etc) possible as this will drastically improve security.
